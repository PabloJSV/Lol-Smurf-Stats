# Lol-Smurf-Stats
League of Legends Smurf stats per user
HOW TO USE:
- Clone the repo
- Create a .env file from the .env.example file in the root directory
- Add your API token to the .env file (you can get it from https://developer.riotgames.com/ )
- Add your summoner name to the .env file
- Run Smurf detector.py


Boosted detector is in Alpha, relies heavily on many API calls so a refactor is probably needed to make it usable.
